# Kiirus.js

This framework is builded to test different native tecnologies, like Custom Elements, HTML5 History API, and some patterns like Virtual DOM, Observer and Redux.

The idea is to use just Vanilla JavaScript generating as few lines of code as possible. Performance is a point to take into consideration, but first I will focus on everything working well.
